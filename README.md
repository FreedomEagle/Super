## Final Q1

###Volume of a Superellipsoid in 5-dimensional space.

        *From a given equation of the superellipsoid, Monte Carlo Integration was applied using the Differential Equation Solving Library tofind its volume.
        *By deducing and analyzing the statstical error using the  Statstical Library, we fix the number of points until the error is less than <3 per trial
       
       
       
       **As n gets larger and largerm the superellipsoid is approaching the cube with edge length equal to 2; thus V(n) 2^5 = 32**
